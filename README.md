## ```@MissRose_bot``` Default Anti-Spam/Flood/Alt-Right Configuration

### A basic set of settings for an instance of [@MissRose_bot](https://missrose.org/) Telegram bot in order to prevent spam and flooding attacks.
#### :warning: Follow the three steps below to run a pre-configured instance of ```@MissRose_bot``` in your group. :warning:

*  Make sure that your group is a [supergroup](https://telegram.org/blog/supergroups5k), which means, that you have to activate history for new members.

* To successfully deploy the bot into your channel, invite ```@MissRose_bot``` into your channel. After inviting ```@MissRose_bot``` to your channel, make sure to give it admin rights. **At this point and at any point, where new admins are introduced to the channel, run ```/admincache```, to let ```@MissRose_bot``` know the current list of admins.**

* Download and send the ```RoseBotDefaultConfig.txt``` file to your channel. Reply with ```/import``` to the message containing the file.
